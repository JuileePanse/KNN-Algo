# KNN-Algorithm
 The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine
 learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
 This algorithm is dependent on distance for classification, normalizing the training data can improve its accuracy dramatically.

<li>It is used when: </li>
    - You have a bunch of objects that have been classified, and</li>
    - You want a way to automatically clasify similar objects that haven’t gotten classified.</li><br>

<li>Procedure of automation</li>
Step 1: Define similarity of two objects
Step 2: Compare the similarity of a given unrated object with all the classified objects.
Step 3: Take the most similar objects and call them neighbors, who each have a “label.”
Step 4: Determine the "label" of the unrated object.
