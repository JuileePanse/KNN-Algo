# KNN-Algorithm
 The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine
 learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
 This algorithm is dependent on distance for classification, normalizing the training data can improve its accuracy dramatically.

<li>It is used when: </li>
<li>you have a bunch of objects that have been classified, and<li>
<li>you want a way to automatically clasify similar objects that havenâ€™t gotten classified.<li>
